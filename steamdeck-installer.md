## Modded Enter the Gungeon Setup for Steam Deck / Linux

### Installing

- Download [the Steam Deck installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pcrain/gungeon-modding-tools/master/steamdeck-installer.sh) into an empty directory somewhere on your file system:
- Open a terminal in the directory containing the above script, and run the following commands:
  ```
    chmod +x ./steamdeck-installer.sh # make the script executable

    ./steamdeck-installer.sh # actually run the script
  ```
- Follow the remaining instructions and prompts on screen.

### Playing

On a standard Steam Deck installation, you will be able to launch the game by running the following script (including quotes) in a terminal:

```
"/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Enter the Gungeon/start_game_bepinex.sh"
```

You can also add the path to the above script to your Steam library as a non-Steam game.

Please report any issues with the install script to `@Captain Pretzel` in the [Mod the Gungeon Discord](https://discord.gg/uT7AwbcpyC):
